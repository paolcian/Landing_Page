##Landing Page

Udacity nanodegree 'Front End Web Developer' bootcamp 
Project 2 "# Landing_Page" 

The starter code has been provided by Udacity but I made some changes in all files (index.html, style.css, app.js).

##Requirements:

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.
It should be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page.
When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

##Structure:

The project has a structure like the one shown below. 
1. css
 * styles.css 
   
2. index.html

3. js
* app.js

4. README.md

5. images
